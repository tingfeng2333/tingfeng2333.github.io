<h2>Project experience</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Linux Lightweight High Concurrency Web Server Development <br />
<b>Project description</b>:Provide web background response services for personal display web pages, parse HTTP data, process GET request related logic and support high concurrent connections, allocate and maintain connection resources, and support clients to access resources such as pictures and videos on the server. <br />
<b>Main work</b>:adopt the simulated Proactor event processing mode, use socket and epoll to implement HTTP connection management, use thread pool and task queue to implement concurrent processing of connection tasks, design idle task timers to efficiently manage inactive connections, and regularly clean up and release resources. <br />
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Surface defect detection of large electrical equipment <br />
  <b>Project description</b>:Collect data with robotic arms and cameras, and automatically select inspection programs according to different inspection units to realize intelligent identification of equipment defects. <br />
  <b>Main work</b>:Combined with digital image processing technology, design and implement defect detection methods for 26 detection items, including screw detection algorithm based on MSER, button detection algorithm based on GLCM, etc. The recognition accuracy rate reaches 98%. <br />
  <b>Project achievements</b>:A set of equipment surface defect detection procedures have been written. With the help of robotic arms, the surface defects can be accurately detected. <br />
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Research and Display Optimization of Oil Well Imaging Data Mapping Technology <br />
  <b>Project description</b>:During imaging logging, array electronic scanning technology is used to obtain two-dimensional images around the wellbore, and then the blank strips appearing in the imaging are repaired, and targets such as cracks and
  gravels are identified. <br />
  <b>Main work</b>:Based on Logik (logging system software) cross-platform development software and source code, complete repair and detection work, including blank strip repair based on bilateral filtering downsampling operator and NFF random
  search, and contour acquisition and recognition based on OpenCV . <br />
  <b>Project results</b>:Assisted in completing the entire set of testing procedures and integrated them into the Logik platform. <br />
